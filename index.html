          <b>sigi</b> is an organizing tool for terminal lovers who hate
          organizing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use <b>sigi</b> as extra memory. Use it to toss your tasks, groceries,
          or the next board games you want to play onto a "stack." Shell aliases
          are encouraged to organize your various stacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The original idea from <a href="https://so.dang.cool">J.R. Hill</a>:
        </p>
        <p class='quotation'>
          I hope <b>sigi</b> will help you to get on with your life, by helping
          you prioritize better, forget less, get some stuff done, and relax. ðŸŒ´
          <br><br>
          There's <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?SevenPlusOrMinusTwo">a limit to
          human memory</a>, and remembering things uses up
          <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307740/willpower-by-roy-f-baumeister-and-john-tierney/">willpower</a>.
          I like working at a command line, and wanted a tool to free me up from
          trying to juggle tasks and ideas.
          <br><br>
          On a more personal level, while I love beauty and craftsmanship and
          accomplishing things... I absolutely despise spending time organizing.
          A five factor personality evaluation rated me at 7% in the orderliness
          aspect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness">
          conscientousness</a>, which (among other things) means I am both less
          disturbed by chaos and more disturbed by order than 92% of humankind.
          <br><br>
          <b>sigi</b> intends to be far more flexible and messy, and far less
          rigid and tidy, when compared to the plethora of personal and
          professional organizational tools that exist. It will let you write
          stuff down and look at that stuff when you want to. It's less like a
          Google/Outlook/Apple Calendar application and more like a
          pen-and-paper notebook.
          <br><br>
          I also just find that stacks, and stack-based languages like Forth
          and Factor are a joy to play with. Also, they're a good fit for
          organization. Usually older things that aren't "done" or "deletable"
          are things that can wait more than whatever things are actively
          being juggled.

        <h2 id="examples_todolist"><b>sigi</b> as a to-do list</h2>

        <p>
          <b>sigi</b> can understand the subcommands <b>do</b> (add something)
          and <b>done</b> (mark the current something completed).
        </p>
        <pre>
$ alias todo='sigi --stack todo'

$ todo do Write some code
Creating: Write some code

$ todo do Get a drink
Creating: Get a drink

$ todo do Take a nap
Creating: Take a nap

$ todo list
Now: Take a nap

            It's best to use <b>sigi</b> behind a few saved aliases with
            unique "stacks". These stacks do not get shared. You should save
            these aliases in your <b>~/.bashrc</b> or <b>~/.zshrc</b> or
            whatever your shell uses for aliases or abbreviations. <b>sigi</b>
            accepts a <b>--stack</b> option, and you can have as many stacks
            as you can think of names.
          </p>
          <p>
              Forgot what to do next?
            </p>
            <pre>
$ todo
Now: Get a drink

Not going to do it?

$ todo delete
Deleted: Get a drink
            </pre>

        <h2 id="examples_anylist"><b>sigi</b> as a to-do list</h2>
        <p>
          <b>sigi</b> can also serve as a save-anything list.
        </p>
        <p>
          Extending the alias idea, you can use sigi to store anything you want
          to remember later.
        </p>
        <pre>
$ alias watch-later='sigi --stack watch-later'

$ watch-later add One Punch Man
Creating: One Punch Man

$ alias story-ideas='sigi --stack=story-ideas'

$ story-ideas add Alien race lives backwards through time.
Creating: Alien race lives backwards through time.
